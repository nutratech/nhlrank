 NHL ranker

Track current rankings, as well as trends and recent patterns.

Model the probability of winning the next game, making playoffs, winning
specific playoff games, or the championship as a whole.

I hope to expend the individual/player statistics at some point too.

Initially this will be hosted as a static HTML (craiglist-style) website
rendered by a Flask API.
