 NHL ranker

Track current rankings, as well as trends and recent patterns for your favorite
team.

Model the probability of winning the next game, making playoffs, winning
specific playoff games, or the championship as a whole.


Notes
#####

I hope to extend this to include individual/player statistics at some point
too.

Initially this will be available as a command line interface.

Eventually this will be hosted as a static HTML (craigslist-style) website
rendered by a Flask API.  Or by a more friendly UI (e.g. Svelte with a Flask
backend).
